LINTER/CODE STYLER:
(using the JavaScript default style guidlines: https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
-We used the Prettier ESLint combination plugin on VS Code which is available by looking up "Prettier ESLint" on the VS Code plugin page.
(The download instructions loosly follow the instructions on the Prettier ESLinter documentation underneath the download on VS Code, see this page for extra troubleshooting)
-Download that plugin, you may need to restart VS Code for it to take effect. Then type CTRL+ALT+P(windows) or CMD+SHIFT+P(mac) to show all commands in VS Code, type format document wtih, and set Prettier ESLint to be the default format
-Three dependencies need to be downloaded: eslint@6.8.0, prettier@1.9.1, & prettier-eslint@10.1.0, to download these, run npm install and the name of the dependecy in the directory you want to be affected by the style checker
-Then the style checker should be set up, to format a file, run SHIFT+ALT+F(windows) or SHIFT+OPTION+F(mac)
-There is also an option to set up auto format on save in Settings on VS Code
